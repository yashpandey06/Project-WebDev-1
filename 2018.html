                        <p> Description- Friction stir processing (FSP) is a rapidly emerging newer solid-state
                            technique
                            for composite fabrication. It involves surface modification which in turn enables successful
                            adaptation of surface properties through plastic deformations in solid state. During initial
                            years of FSP inception, it was primarily employed in development of metal matrix composites
                            of
                            light metal alloys like aluminum. However, recently, it has gained an alluring role in
                            fabrication of composites of various nonferrous and ferrous metal alloys as well as of
                            polymers.
                            In addition to composite fabrication, FSP has evolved as a revolutionary technique in
                            developing
                            functionally graded systems/surfaces (FGS) of metal matrix. This article covers all aspects
                            of
                            FSP in which reinforcement particles are embedded in the base matrix to develop composites
                            and
                            FGS.</p>

                        is a landmark ability of the additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Parametric optimisation of
                        fused deposition modelling process using Fortus 250mc modeller is accomplished for conical
                        primitives of constructive solid geometry in the present research. Experiments were designed
                        according to the Taguchi technique for four factors at three levels each- slice height (SH),
                        contour width (CW), raster width and air gap (AG). Analysis of signal-to-noise ratios is
                        utilised for establishing the optimal process parameters and the relative percentage
                        contribution of factors is estimated using ANOVA. Optimal levels of process parameters are found
                        to vary with the variation in the type of basic shape of primitive. It has been established that
                        AG has a maximum impact over the part build volume followed by CW and SH.</p>

                        Description-Fabrication of metal matrix surface composites (SCs) is an emerging trend of
                        friction stir processing applications. Key factors affecting the properties of SCs are process
                        parameters, tool geometry, tool dimensions and reinforcement strategies. In this research,
                        effects of different reinforcement strategies and varying tool offset positions on dispersion of
                        reinforcement particles in the base matrix are investigated. The experiments were performed in
                        two phases using AA6063 as base metal at constant process parameters of 1120 rpm rotational
                        speed, 40 mm/min traverse speed and 2.5° tilt angle. In the first phase, effect of six different
                        reinforcement strategies on the reinforcement particles distribution and defect formation was
                        studied. It was found that groove method with tool offset in retreating side (RS) exhibited
                        better homogeneity in reinforcement distribution out of the six reinforcement strategies
                        considered.

                    <p>    Description- Currently, most of the major commercial metal additive manufacturing (MAM)
                        techniques rely on liquid phase processing. The liquid to solid phase transformations in these
                        techniques results in microstructural issues and defects which in turn tantamount to inferior
                        properties of fabricated build. Friction based additive manufacturing technologies are solid
                        state processing techniques which work on the principles of friction based joining processes and
                        layer by layer additive manufacturing. This book primarily addresses the basic understanding of
                        seven friction based additive manufacturing techniques. These techniques include additive
                        manufacturing methods based on rotary friction welding, linear friction welding, friction
                        deposition, friction surfacing, friction stir additive manufacturing, friction assisted seam
                        welding and additive friction stir.</p>

                       <p> Description:Additive manufacturing (AM) is around three-decade-old technology and enables quick
                        transition from concept to physical models in a matter of hours. Fused deposition modelling
                        (FDM) is a promising and robust AM technique with proven ability to build prototypes of complex
                        and intricate shapes using reasonable time and cost. Optimisation of FDM process requires
                        optimisation of various qualitative and quantitative responses. This work presents
                        multi-objective FDM optimisation using RSM embedded fuzzy logic analysis. Six process parameters
                        and two responses are considered for the current experimentation on Fortus 250mc modeller based
                        on FDM technology.

                       <p> Description-Friction stir processing (FSP) is a relatively newly developed solid-state process
                        involving surface modifications for fabricating metal matrix surface composites. Obtaining metal
                        matrix nano-composites with uniform dispersion of reinforcement particles via FSP route is an
                        intricate task to accomplish. In this work, AA5059/SiC nano surface composites (SCs) were
                        developed. Effect of multiple FSP passes and SiC addition on microstructure and mechanical
                        properties of fabricated SCs during underwater condition was investigated. Results reflected
                        that the average microhardness value of base metal (BM) increases from 85 Hv to 159 Hv in stir
                        zone of four pass underwater friction stir processed (FSPed) SC.</p>

                        composites. Experimental design was accomplished using Taguchi technique and three factors at
                        three levels each were utilized. These factors include-rotational speed of tool, traverse speed
                        of tool and tool shoulder diameter. Responses such as microhardness, ultimate tensile strength
                        (UTS), yield strength (YS) and percentage elongation (% EL) are modeled using regression
                        analysis based on Taguchi's orthogonal array design of experiment. Optimum combinations of
                        process parameters were determined for the selected responses. It was found that each of three
