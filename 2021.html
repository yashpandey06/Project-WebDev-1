                   <p> Description - Solid state metal additive manufacturing (SS-MAM) techniques based on friction
                    stir engineering (FSE) have gained significant attention since the last decade and act as a
                    bridge for many existing MAM shortfalls. In this article, SS-MAM techniques based upon FSE
                    especially additive friction stir (AFS) and friction stir additive manufacturing (FSAM) are
                    discussed. There is meagre research with respect to tooling associated with these processes
                    since they involve expertise in two fields i.e., AM and FSE. The current article bridges this
                    gap with a detailed discussion on all relevant fundamentals of AFS and FSAM. The recent
                    developments with respect to tooling design and parameters are discussed in-depth. Also, this
                    article discusses metallurgy, microstructural aspects and mechanical properties of deposited
                    layers via these techniques. A detailed timeline summarizing the development with respect to
                    these techniques.</p>

                      <p>  Description - Friction stir additive manufacturing (FSAM) is a novel friction based additive
                        manufacturing technology that can be effectively utilized to fabricate fully dense components in
                        solid state with improved structural performance. In this work, Al5059/SiC composite component
                        of approximately 20 mm height was developed using FSAM technique. Microstructural and
                        microhardness characterization of fabricated component was done to evaluate the microstructural
                        changes and, bonding between subsequent layers of fabricated build. Results reflected that
                        fabricated build exhibits smaller grain size and higher micro-hardness as compared to base
                        metal. A maximum enhancement of ∼62% in micro-hardness of the build was achieved as compared to
                        base metal.</p>

                       <p> Description - Friction stir welding (FSW) was performed in the current research on Al 5059
                        alloy. Nano-sized SiC (n-SiC) particles were incorporated during FSW for improving mechanical
                        characteristics of welds. Effect of tool rotating speed and multiple FSW passes was studied on
                        SiC dispersion, micro structural changes and mechanical characteristics of composite joints.
                        Results reflected that rotational speed and multiple FSW passes have significant impact over the
                        distribution of SiC reinforcement. Further, the pattern of SiC distribution in the base metal
                        strongly affects the micro structural evolution and mechanical characteristics of welds. An
                        increase of ~55% in microhardness values was achieved in the stir zone of composite joint.
                        Correspondingly, higher ultimate tensile strength (342 MPa) value was obtained as compared to
                        base metal (321 MPa). The increase in mechanical characteristics is mainly owing to grain

                        <p>Description - The strength of weld joint largely depends on depth of penetration of metal at
                            fusion zone. The present study aims to investigate effect of five activated fluxes, viz. Al2
                            (SO4)3, NaOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and borax in MIG welding on depth of penetration and mechanical
                            properties of AISI 1018. Results reflected that use of flux had paramount influence on the
                            microstructure and hardness of the bead on plate welds. It helps in increasing depth of
                            penetration via reverse Marangoni effect. Out of all five fluxes, Borax flux had provided higher
                            depth of penetration, external and internal aspect ratio and hardness than other fluxes used as
                            well as than without flux.

                     <p>   Description - Low depth of penetration limits the use of favored tungsten inert gas (TIG)
                        welding process for joining of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, demanding weld bead profile of
                        high quality. This article aims to study the effect of chloride and oxide fluxes viz. calcium
                        chloride (CaCl2) and ferric oxide (Fe2O3) on micro-structural and mechanical properties of TIG
                        welded joints of dissimilar SS304 and SS202 steels. Results reflected that use of oxide and
                        chloride fluxes significantly affects the weld bead geometry, bead dimensions and penetration.
                        The use of oxide flux resulted in complete penetration and approximately linear root of weld
                        with good fusion of both the base metals. Fusion zone showed columnar dendritic cast grain
                        structure while coarse grain structure was obtained in heat-affected zone. Fusion zone hardness
                        was higher than SS304 base metal and an opposite trend observed for SS202 irrespective of
                        welding.</p>

                        research domain and have various intriguing applications. Immense developments have been
                        witnessed in the field of FGMs over the past few decades. These include advancements in
                        processing techniques as well as applications. Various processing techniques have been discussed

                        affect the performance of FSW. In this research work, an attempt was made to analyze the effect
                        of rotation speed of tool (TRS) on the weld quality of friction stir welded joints of AA6061

                        throughout the experimentation. Results reflected that RST significantly affects the weld
