<p>Description - Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are superiorly engineered as well as natural materials with customized properties. These materials offer a variety of advantages over conventional materials in specific engineering applications. High strength, improved ductility, superior mechanical properties and enhanced surface properties are some advantages of FGMs when compared to homogeneous materials of the same type. Engineered FGMs have intrigued numerous researchers in recent years. These materials were conceived as thermal obstruction materials for various critical applications. These are increasingly being employed for numerous conventional as well as advanced applications. Many methods are utilized in developing FGMs possessing specific advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews current trends and developments of functionally graded materials (FGMs).</p>

                        <p>Description - Fabrication of metal matrix surface composites is an emerging trend of friction stir processing (FSP) applications. This research proposes fabrication of AA 6063/SiC surface composites (SCs) using FSP. Influences of FSP process parameters viz. tool rotational speed, traverse speed and tilt angle were investigated on the distribution of reinforcement particles and mechanical properties of SCs. Experiments were designed using Taguchi technique. Optimum combinations of process parameters were determined for higher microhardness and ultimate tensile strength respectively using signal/noise ratio graphs, response tables and analysis of variance method. Results revealed that the uniform dispersion of reinforcement particles and appreciable improvement in mechanical properties was achieved by employing optimal combinations of 1,400 rpm tool rotational speed, 40 mm/min traverse speed and 2.5° tilt angle.</p>

                       <p> Description - Generative manufacturing is an innovative technology which is almost 30 years old. It has the ability of quickly transforming concept into physical models. The design cycle is contracted manifolds by utilising these techniques. One of a versatile generative manufacturing technique is fused deposition modelling (FDM) which is used for production of robust and economical prototypes. In the present research, effect of percentage contribution of critical process parameters on the build time requirements of the FDM process is examined for the given build volume in Fortus 250MC modeller. ABS P430 cubical and spherical primitives of constructive solid geometry, which display spatial symmetry in a given build volume, are chosen as work piece. Response surface methodology is utilised as the statistical tool for experimental design and modelling. This work is an attempt towards explicitly defining the process parameters.</p>

<p>Description - Friction stir processing (FSP) is a quite recently developed solid-state process involving surface modifications for fabricating metal matrix surface composites (SCs). In this work, FSP has been utilized to fabricate SCs of AA5059 alloy matrix using SiC particles as reinforcement. Current method of SCs fabrication involves repeated/ multi-pass FSP overlapping each other at constant process parameters. Three FSP passes were carried out with two sizes of SiC particles, viz. micrometer SiC (μ-SiC) and nanometer SiC (n-SiC). The values of speed of rotation, speed of traverse, tool tilt angle and tool offset were kept constant at 710 rpm, 50mm/min, 2∘ and 1.5 mm respectively. Mechanical properties (microhardness and ultimate tensile strength) corresponding to each condition were measured and compared with an aim to investigate the effects of SiC particles sizes and multiple FSP passes.</p>

<p>Description - Friction stir additive techniques (FSATs) constitute innovative approaches aimed at utilizing layer by layer additive manufacturing (AM) principle with solid state friction stir welding (FSW) technique. These constitute a special class of friction based additive techniques (FATs) and can be easily thought of as major breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) domain. Ability of MAM techniques to be used for fabricating intricate parts has led them to be considered as a lucrative option for aviation, automotive, and marine sectors. However, fusion based MAM techniques have manifold limitations mainly owing to solidification related as well as poor shear strength issues. FATs overcome drawbacks of fusion based MAM methods chiefly because of their solid-state nature. FATs fabricate defect free components possessing superior structural and mechanical characteristics.</p>
