                        <p> Description- Aluminium matrix surface composites are gaining alluring role especially in
                            aerospace, defence, and marine industries. Friction stir processing (FSP) is a promising
                            novel
                            solid state technique for surface composites fabrication. In this study, AA6061/SiC surface
                            composites were fabricated and the effect of tool plunge depth on pattern of reinforcement
                            particles dispersion in metal matrix was investigated. Six varying tool plunge depths were
                            chosen at constant levels of shoulder diameter and tool tilt angle to observe the exclusive
                            effect of plunge variation. Process parameters chosen for the experimentation are speed of
                            rotation, travel speed and tool tilt angle which were taken as 1400 rpm, 40 mm/min, and
                            2.5°respectively. Macro and the microstructural study were performed using stereo zoom and
                            optical microscope respectively. Results reflected that lower plunge depth levels lead to
                            insufficient heat generation</p>

                            optimal layout plan with minimal build time, model material volume, support volume and thus
                            production cost for a Fortus 250mc modeler. ABS plastic is used as a raw material and
                            cylindrical primitives with pre specified STL dimensions are taken as the component. This
                            study focuses on multi response optimization of layout plan for different FDM parameters as
                            well as spatial orientations. Experiments are conducted using full factorial central
                            composite design. Response surface methodology based desirability analysis was employed for
                            optimization of FDM process parameters namely, contour width, raster width, air gap, raster
                            angle, slice height and orientation based on multiple performance characteristics including
                            build time, model material volume and support material volume.</p>

                        composite fabrication where their fabrication is accomplished in solid state. In the current
                        research, AA6063/SiC surface composites were fabricated and effect of ratio of groove width (w)
                        to tool pin diameter (d) on dispersion of reinforcement particles and mechanical properties were
                        investigated. Five varying groove widths were chosen at constant levels of tool dimensions and
                        process parameters to observe the exclusive effect of variation of groove width on area of
                        developed SCs. Results reflected that groove width have strong impact on the area of surface
                        composites and a ratio of w/d of 0.5 was found optimum for developing high volume percentage of
                        40% of SiC reinforced surface composites. The results were supported by macro and
                        microstructural images.</p>

                        requirements for fused deposition modelling process is studied. Constructive solid geometry
                        cylindrical primitive is taken as work piece and modeling is accomplished for it. Response
                        surface methodology is used to design the experiments and obtain statistical models for build
                        time requirements corresponding to different orientations of the given primitive in modeller
                        build volume. Contour width, air gap, slice height, raster width, raster angle and angle of
                        orientation are treated as process parameters. Percentage contribution of individual process
                        parameter is found to change for build time corresponding to different spatial orientations.
                        Also, the average of build time requirement changes with spatial orientation.</p>

                       <p> Description- Weight reduction is one of the major objectives in engineering design and
                        manufacturing, especially in automotive and aircraft industries. Aluminium (Al) alloys provide
                        the solution for weight reduction in various structural applications. Forfurther enhancement
                        ofsurface properties of these alloys, their surface composites are fabricated which exhibit high
                        strength - weight ratio, better corrosion resistance, improved mechanical & wear properties as
                        compared to base alloys. In this work, an attempt has been made to enhance the
                        processed-layerhardness of AA 6063 sheets by synthesizing AA 6063/SiC surface composites using
                        friction stir processing (FSP). Single pass FSP was performed on AA 6063 sheets using tool
                        rotational speedat three levels of 900, 1120and 1400 rpm respectively.Traverse speed was
                        maintained at a constant level of 40 millimetres/minute and tool tilt angle was kept at 2˚</p>

                            model material volume in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process on a FDM Maxum Modeler. A

                            proposed and applied to optimize process parameters of FDM process. The significant input

                            considered, and build time and model material have been taken as responses for this study.
                            Thirty experiments were conducted on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) P400 for conical
                            primitives using full factorial central composite design. The optimum process parameter
