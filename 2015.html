                        Description-

                        Improved surface characteristics while retaining the bulk properties is the unique
                        characteristic of the surface composites. Friction stir processing (FSP) is a novel and green
                        process for fabrication of surface composites. In this work, synthesis of AA 6063/Sic surface
                        composites via FSP is reported. A single pass FSP was carried out on AA 6063-T6 plates with SiC
                        reinforcement particles using constant tool rotational speed of 1120 rpm and varying traverse
                        speeds of 30 mm/min, 40 mm/min and 50 mm/min with tool tilt angle of 2. Optical microscopy was
                        used to study the effect of traverse speed on the microstructure of the fabricated surface
                        composites. Results show that SiC particles were uniformly distributed in the metal matrix.
                        Optimal homogeneity in distribution was obtained corresponding to the traverse speed of 40
                        mm/min. It was further noted that there was no interfacial reaction found between the aluminium
                        matrix and SiC particles.

                      <p>  Description-Functionally graded materials (FGM) which are also called tailor made materials,
                        are composites with continuously varying mechanical properties. The limitations on the component
                        materials available for specific RP processes calls for the development of tailor made material
                        properties in the available material options. This paper proposes a technique to develop and
                        fabricate FGM using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique. An attempt is made to relate the
                        FDM process parameters with the material properties for the given ABS material. These relations
                        are used to assign tailor made properties to the component in various regions. By actual CAD
                        modeling and analysis using ANSYS 14, it is established that the deformation due to given load
                        is considerably reduced for the component made by assigning unique set of parameters in a
                        customized fashion.</p>
